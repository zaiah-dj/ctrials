	 - Made some big fixes to schema.sql and populate.sql.  Running locally or creating the databases from scratch should be easy to do now.
	 - Fixed JS bug in which an exception would be thrown when releasing participants into an "empty list".

	 - Added a column in the database for wrmup_starttime to tables frm_retl and frm_eetl

Wed, Sep 12, 2018  4:35:26 PM
	 - Added a new API endpoint to update the wrmup_starttime.  Also fixed the disappearing yes/no when activating togglers, but will probably end up getting rid of this.
	 - Fixed many issues with boxes not showing up correctly when clicked.

	 - Split out API into it's own ... uh... "app"
	 - Notes now add at the top of the list and include the date.
	 - Looked into Blood Pressure readings, but still need to investigate why sometimes the right BP is not being returned.
	 - Fixed 'view more' link.

	 - Drag and drop was broken due to an exception.  While cleaning up, neglected to remove references to function 'checkAtSubmit()', and this broke the drag and drop interface.

	 - Questions at the top of the input.cfm questionnaire should all be one line.

	 - Weeks track automatically and change as we progress forward in time (oooOOooOOh)
	 - The week can be changed in development versions by using week=YYYY-MM-DD in the URL.
	 - Scuse me: that's startweek=YYYY-MM-DD
	 - Perhaps I need to add something else that can delete this test data.
	 - Still working on adding a modal window that can display all previous weeks results.
	 - Will add a CSV or a straight up SQL file that can populate in a way that I can test this correctly.
	 - Changed participant IDs to use SQL Server's newid() function to generate unique identifiers.  This is only important for testing.
	 - Changed all table names in SQL queries to variables.  This makes it easy to switch backends.
	 - Updated the check-in page to use #currentWeek# instead of #model.currentWeek#
