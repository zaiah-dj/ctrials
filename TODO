- Write superset columns 

- Fix N/A verbiage to include type of range being recorded

- Let Debbie / Jack know about all the new columns

- Split out the API, b/c it may make it easier to take care of 

- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

- A better progress checker will look for something else before marking an exercise as done

- Check mark seems to be broken, dunno why...

- You need a pubsub, this might be more important than I thought... 

- Docs...

- Favicon

- Application.cfc vs data.cfm (easier to read and follow for your customer)
