TOP PRIORITY
=================
- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)
		frm_RESL

- Send a meeting request with you, jack and debbie

- start docs

? Checkmark is not showing on production, why?
	login and check this

? Stop Session button disappears on horiz view
		the button and header changes may have solved this... check again 

- switch to simple form input for 24hr time (not the changeable div) (30m)
- incrementors on one line / super big input page (30m)
- position: fixed exercise selection menu on input.cfm (15-30, if fixed does not work, this will be rather difficult)
- drop down menus should be on top (why are they not?)

- notifications (1hr, USER_[UN]ASSIGNED, PARTICIPANT_[UN]ASSIGNED)
- configuration in Application.cfc (15-30m)

x matching color scheme on recovery page (5m), also need to try a different checker thingy, cuz it's too hard to see
C big buttons on half width default.cfm (5m) (not needed...)
x three top sitting columns on assigned page (10m, media query)
x pretty list views on js-overlay-window (10m, style hidden form)

- renderable / updateable might be rough and a bit error prone, so wait on that
- previous weeks 
- organize CSS 

x kill input.collapsible

- double tap move?


PRODUCTION CHECKS
=================
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?
