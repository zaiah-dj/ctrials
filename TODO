x hh:mm field and timestamp added when pressing the now, or begin button
		how to do a formatted text box?
			js is one way, I wonder if there's a built-in way	

- being able to edit box is next

- superset value recall (maybe you can store the value elsewhere, so it's always known?)
	get clarification on this during the meeting, 
	if it's just the specific exercises, 
	then do not show superset everywhere

- Get 00:00 on click to work by changing to content-editable (or whatever it was I used...)

- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)
		frm_RESL


- Finish assigned participant list
		we're not pulling by site... but the way to test shouldn't be difficult...

x Fix N/A verbiage to include type of range being recorded (works but is too big)


- current bp, must be still not be solved


- recheck recall... 
	i wonder if this is due to a difference in exercise types selected (for example hips one day, and the other thing another day, specifically check Ennis Jones)


- check values before checking progress 


- Stop Session button disappears on horiz view, you need to fix this on both vert and horiz


- Animated slider movements...

PRODUCTION CHECKS
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?



BE EXTRA NICE TO HIM, MA
? put everything in const., and I MEAN EVERYTHING!
		this is a bigger change than I thought.  
		It would be easier if all of this were in a database.
		Then, the final move, would be to get rid of both component files

		*const has proven hard to work with and still doesn't really solve the full problem.
		*putting this in SQL is a bit tougher, but should make it easier to manage from one location, not to mention stop it from breaking
			may have to use a union with the resultant row 
			IF NULL will probably be needed to make the values show up right
			adding the form vars to the query may help simplify things a lot as well...
			additionally, you'll need an admin page where users can go in and make changes if need be...

- There are lots of templates using loops, this is difficult to manage and takeover, so keep it simple and repeat yourself...

- objects
		currentParticipant can have its own thing
			cp.init( query to select current participant )
			cp.isEndurance()
			cp.getName()
		form valueS?

- increase padding on all containers that scroll (the bar is too close to the edge of the parent window)

- Try to better enforce model logic (lots of ifs) 

- Split out the API, b/c it may make it easier to take care of 

- You need a pubsub, this might be more important than I thought... 

- Docs...

- Application.cfc vs data.cfm (easier to read and follow for your customer)
