		how to do a formatted text box?
			js is one way, I wonder if there's a built-in way	

? put everything in const., and I MEAN EVERYTHING!
		this is a bigger change than I thought.  
		It would be easier if all of this were in a database.
		Then, the final move, would be to get rid of both component files


- superset value recall (maybe you can store the value elsewhere, so it's always known?)
	get clarification on this during the meeting, 
	if it's just the specific exercises, 
	then do not show superset everywhere



- frm_resl?
	resistance people are going to be tough to work with, that's all you need fortunately, 


- Fix N/A verbiage to include type of range being recorded


- current bp, must be still not be solved


- recheck recall... 
	i wonder if this is due to a difference in exercise types selected (for example hips one day, and the other thing another day, specifically check Ennis Jones)


- check before checking progress 


- Stop Session button disappears on horiz view, you need to fix this on both vert and horiz


- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)

PRODUCTION CHECKS
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?



BE EXTRA NICE TO HIM, MA
- Split out the API, b/c it may make it easier to take care of 

- You need a pubsub, this might be more important than I thought... 

- Docs...

- Application.cfc vs data.cfm (easier to read and follow for your customer)

- Favicon
