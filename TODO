TOP PRIORITY

x Pull tickler participants in by site (how to test? - dunno yet..., you can drop your own thing in, i suppose or use data.cfm)

x Finish assigned participant list
		assigned to others

- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)
		frm_RESL

- Hamburger window on smaller widths 

- adjacent arrows

- const value things

- Javascript to detect actual work (if ANYTHING changes, it will register as done, if a button is simply pressed, it won't)

x Javascript fix to allow new info on drag and droppers...

? Checkmark is not showing on production, why?

x selected, assigned, available

? Stop Session button disappears on horiz view
		the button and header changes may have solved this... check again 





PRODUCTION CHECKS
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?



BE EXTRA NICE TO HIM, MA
? put everything in const., and I MEAN EVERYTHING!
		this is a bigger change than I thought.  
		It would be easier if all of this were in a database.
		Then, the final move, would be to get rid of both component files

		*const has proven hard to work with and still doesn't really solve the full problem.
		*putting this in SQL is a bit tougher, but should make it easier to manage from one location, not to mention stop it from breaking
			may have to use a union with the resultant row 
			IF NULL will probably be needed to make the values show up right
			adding the form vars to the query may help simplify things a lot as well...
			additionally, you'll need an admin page where users can go in and make changes if need be...

- There are lots of templates using loops, this is difficult to manage and takeover, so keep it simple and repeat yourself...
		switch to copy pasta...

- objects
		currentParticipant can have its own thing
			cp.init( query to select current participant )
			cp.isEndurance()
			cp.getName()
		exercise? (when initializing all data on input, a specific time or exercise is selected)	

- Try to better enforce model logic (lots of ifs in templates) 

- You need a pubsub, this might be more important than I thought... 

- Docs...

- Application.cfc vs data.cfm (easier to read and follow for your customer)
