TOP PRIORITY
=================
- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)
		frm_RESL


? Checkmark is not showing on production, why?

? Stop Session button disappears on horiz view
		the button and header changes may have solved this... check again 

- incrementors on one line (30m)
- configuration in Application.cfc (15-30m)
- notifications (1hr, USER_[UN]ASSIGNED, PARTICIPANT_[UN]ASSIGNED)
- switch to simple form input for 24hr time (not the changeable div) (30m)
- position: fixed exercise selection menu on input.cfm (15-30, if fixed does not work, this will be rather difficult)
- matching color scheme on recovery page (5m)
- big buttons on half width default.cfm (5m)
- three top sitting columns on assigned page (10m, media query)
- pretty list views on js-overlay-window (10m, style hidden form)
- gotta do docs , where is everything, what tables are used, etc

- renderable / updateable might be rough and a bit error prone, so wait on that
- previous weeks 
- organize CSS 



PRODUCTION CHECKS
=================
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?
