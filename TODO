- let debbie know that the exercises have changed

- let them know you won't be around today

- checklist before submitting
	data.cfm must be off
	make sure I'm reading from the session tickler

- onSessionEnd() vs just letting it go after the fact

	continue rounding out the buttons
	create a modal window that can sit on top of things to indicate problems/messages (like save data)
	a way to recall record threads (1. b/c of switching participants, 2. b/c I think it needs to be part of query)

	recovery: add reason button does not work
	input: bigger 'stop session' button
	use real tables to write and recall values
	bug on selecting previous results
	color states: (unselected-gray, selected-lightVersionOfColor,inactive-darkVersionOfColor,hover-?,clicked/active-?)
	color at beginning of session should be gray
	color during session should indicate where I am, but other users should not even remotely look like they're selected
	squelch / change design on re/ee pages when selecting, and inputting superset
	no bug out when clicking unchecked-in people (meaning, code for that)
	fix 'add a note' to save in debbie's table
	fix 'review previous results' options to disply previous session entries

	re: edd question 'was exercise done?' for each exercise type...
	re: fields for heart rate, rpe, and affect for warm and end
