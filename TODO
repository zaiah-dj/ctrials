x Check mark seems to be broken, dunno why... (may not have been exclusive enough when searching for previous results)

x Time recording ought to work... why not?

x finally, endurance previous results do not seem to be working......

- fix up retl with the same thing, BUT
		test both retl and eetl
		need to get smart about testing, i dunno ...



- current bp needs to pull up, i wonder why this is not working


- Stop Session button disappears on horiz view




- Fix N/A verbiage to include type of range being recorded

- Write superset values on retl and eetl api forms
		bp1set1, etc

- Plug in to John's eq table for eq settings (not exactly sure how this works)
		frm_RESL

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

- Add checks for checkbox progress completion

- What is up with warmup previous session data?



- Split out the API, b/c it may make it easier to take care of 

- You need a pubsub, this might be more important than I thought... 

- Docs...

- Application.cfc vs data.cfm (easier to read and follow for your customer)

- Favicon
