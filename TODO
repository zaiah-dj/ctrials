TOP PRIORITY
=================
x get with delilah again, have her send you the exception that she was getting
	also test the object, since it's pretty key to everything working

1.	
x italic change on 24 hr time
x 24hr on eetl (they can comment out if not needed)
x modify database (adding wrmup_starttime to frm_eetl and frm_eetl audit )



2.
x at thin views, the main page can't fit all patient info and the release button, 
		consider what is being used in 'Assignments' view

x js on recovery yes/no

x hovers on dropped people are retarded

x add drag listener to newly unassigned people
		(dragging the same individual back over does nothing)

- fix double touch problem 
	listener might not be applied to the right element
	I'd do this on your own end, since it has nothing to do with the app functionality



3.	
- refactor api, init and input to use a central source of data
	all of this can go in application.cfc and be fine

* change data.data.x references to actual database names

* use render and templates to make things simpler to use


4.	
- docs
	how is everything expected to work?
	how does everything actually work?
	databases
	developer notes and whatnot

- how does code look in IDE (15m, this is important because it's hard to follow if not done right)



PRODUCTION CHECKS
=================
- Check and make sure that ALL tables that exist in dev, are in prod

- Get rid of all tables and data not in use

- Save defaults, min and max to either database or constants.cfc

? What is up with warmup previous session data?
