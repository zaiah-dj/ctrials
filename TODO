HEY!  SWITCH TO recoverySave AND DO THE RECOVERY STUFF FIRST

then go to the equipment log and other problems...

- let debbie know that the exercises have changed

- let them know you won't be around today

- checklist before submitting
	data.cfm must be off
	make sure I'm reading from the session tickler

- onSessionEnd() vs just letting it go after the fact
