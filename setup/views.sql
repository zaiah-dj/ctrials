// Short-Term Goals

- Get $250,000/year business started

- NO DEBT AND KILL THE OTHER TWO CARDS!!!!

x Get TubularModular domain running and use a better CMS backend, try to blog weekly?

- Leave current job.  - June 29th should be the end, time is precious and I'm gonna move.  Find something elsewhere, can be small.

- Leave current city. - Be settled by July 27th (earlier is always better)

- Sell this car and possibly the ford too.  - No less than $6000 for both - Uber may really work while you get a roll on - if Balt or another place, a cheap 4 door will do it (and there is a credit card, but I'm not into this for obvious reasons)

- Start some kind of class or other diversion - August is the start date, I've got things to do

? Save $1000 to start the business right (a dba will help - Do I need another checking account?)

- Projects: poker, DAW (icedaw), And, iOS, hypno, canvas, sql/sas/c/js/cf,

- Save $20K (before December / one half is emergency / this goal will probably morph depending on the success and start time of business) - you have $5.6K

- Series 7 (how much?  how soon?  where?)

- Flight School (how much?  $8K  how soon?  ???   where? - There is one in W/S:http://flypft.com/learntofly.html )



// Super short term goals:
	
- Free samples of your business?  How do I do that?
	Apps are always cool to let people try out
	Quick demonstrations of what you can do and why?
	The books (start this as soon as possible)

- Buy some new turntables: DJ Tech SL-1300MK6, Reloop RP-7000	

- Return the Book to Office Depot - 64.64 + 74.89 = 139.53
